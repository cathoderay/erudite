Erudite
=======
This is a simple word game, inspired by daily [NYT games](https://www.nytco.com/products/games/), specially [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

I'm developing this game for some reasons: 
1. improve my vocabulary;
2. practice some javascript/typescript (specially interested in the promising [deno](https://github.com/denoland) runtime);
3. Having fun.

How it works
------------
You have to figure out what is the word based on the definition presented.

If you make an incorrect guess, any correct letter will be highlighted in green in the keyboard.

Desktop version allows you to:
1. simply type the word with your keyboard;
2. delete a letter by pressing `Backspace`;
3. check if word is correct by pressing `Enter`;
4. pick another word/definition by pressing `Esc`.

Demo
----------
Go to https://erudite-demo.deno.dev

Dataset
------
The list of words is a subset of https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt.

The definitions come from wordnet through nltk.

Contributions/collaborations

This is a work in progress.
