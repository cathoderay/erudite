Erudite
=======
A simple word game inspired by Wordle.

How it works
------------
You have to figure out what is the word based on the definition presented. 
If you make an incorrect guess, any correct letter will be highlighted in green in the keyboard.

Desktop version allows you to just type the word and press `Enter` key to check the solution.
Also, pressing `Esc` will pick another word.
